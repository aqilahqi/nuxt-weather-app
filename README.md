# Weather App

A single page app to look up the current weather. Users can also search for a location and see the weather forecast.

I used `Nuxt.js` and `Vuetify`

Demo is available <a href="https://react-googlemap-autocomplete.netlify.app/">here</a>.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
